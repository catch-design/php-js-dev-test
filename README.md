A simple test for PHP / JavaScript Developers

## Instructions

1. Fork or clone this repo
2. Write a script to Import the CSV file located in `data/customers.csv` into a database (MySQL or Mongo is preferred)
3. Create a basic PHP web service that serves the data from the database as JSON
4. Create a basic web page that asynchronously loads the JSON into a list or table when you click a button
5. If you are completing this test as part of a job application please include a zip file of your project (including git config/metadata) with your application otherwise create a pull request and we'll take a look :)

### Guidelines

1. Your repo needs to include at minimum anything required to get the app working.  Detailed instructions should be provided in the `README.md` file to setup and run the app.
2. If a structured schema migration tool is not used then a setup script must be supplied to create any data tables etc
3. Try not spend more than 2 hours on it

### Bonus Points

* Make it Pretty
* Make it as OO as possible
* Consume dependencies with tools like Composer, Bower and NPM
* Use patterns like MVC, ORM
* Compile any front end assets with a build tool like gulp
* Unit tests
